                    Howdy, I'm bonk, also known as nincompoop. I am the owner and head developer of bonksmp. It's the 4th server I have ever made, and currently - the only one I have. (I waited at 12 AM for almost a whole week, waiting for eagler.host to release.)

                    This is that one skeppy guy. He lives a double life, subbing as two people at any given time. You may never know who is who. He's also the only elite in the server so far. He lives two cities away from me, but we go to the same school. He could put more here, cuz I don't know as much about him. I call him "Coner" though.

            The very first functional server I made was on DDNodes. It was just for fun and not many people were intended to join, since it was meant to be a relief for waiting for eagler.host to release. Once it released, the DDNodes server ran out of $DD$'s the next day anyway. The original bonkpixil.eagler.host server was bombed by logan. I recreated it and made a pretty good lobby and roller coaster to a sand village. Not many people have joined, but it was still good. Until some weird glitches happened, that broke the server to the point of deletion. It would be a while until I made another server. Since I didn't know exactly what kind of server bonkpixil was supposed to be, I was able to be lazy and thought up a boring old survival. And thus, the bonksmp was born.

            I wanted to make this server a good one, so I actually switched from Eagler 1.8.8 to 1.12.2, just for a better experience. Then I found the main spawn coordinates and started setting up everything. It was a little rough at first, but eventually I started making the lobby better, also decreasing the chance of spawning underwater (which still somehow failed). I spread out the word of my server to another popular server called BedWetr, where I got inspiration for the original bonkpixil server from. then I gave a cool tester rank to the people from BedWetr. It let them be forever set to live and change their gamemode. Then they kept coming back to make and communicate more, even when I wasn't around (though I could still see them in the console). It looked like my server was perfect.

            But then this guy named i_am_theKing joined, who wasn't a BedWetr player. I was a little suspicious of him at first, but he kept coming, and the others welcomed him, so then I let him have the tester rank. And then Suklemon's castle had huge holes in it, which suk assumed was me and flipped me off, since I blew up small holes in his floor from time to time (justified). The one who destroyed it also left a shrine of some sort (which I gladly demolished) saying he would return. He, in fact, did return, destroying all remaining parts of the castle. The king was quick to accuse kaidun (who keeps to herself and doesn't bug anyone), and og said it was most likely him, and suk also apologized for cursing at me. And then from that day forward, king... wasn't banned. Worse, he was thrown into one of the cells of my house, being unable to leave, break, or use any commands. Me, og and suk laughed at him. Then I gave suk WorldEdit permissions to remake the castle, which looks way better now. There hasn't been destruction since...
